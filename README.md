# 💻 100 Days of Code – CodeWithZai

Welcome to my coding reboot!  
I’m Stephanie — a bootcamp grad, mum in tech, and creative problem-solver since i was yay high. 
This space documents my day-by-day journey as I strengthen my JavaScript skills and rebuild confidence in tech.

---

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- Rebuild consistency and confidence  
- Master JavaScript & React fundamentals  
- Strengthen my problem-solving muscle  
- Revisit DevOps & Cloud concepts with fresh eyes  
- Aim to show up daily — even when it’s messy or imperfect or for one line of code

## 🗂️ How It’s Organised

Each day is a small, focused step forward.  
You'll find my progress logged by topic and day, like this:

- `01/100` – Variables & Data Types  
- `02/100` – Expressions & Operators  
- `03/100` – Loops  
- `04/100` – Conditionals (if, else, while)  
- `05/100` – Functions  

I’m focusing on **clarity before cleverness** — making sure I *understand* the code, not just complete it.
