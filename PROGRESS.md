# 📓 100 Days of Code – Detailed Progress Log

---

## Day 7 – Arrays
**Focus:** Storing lists & using array methods

### ✅ What I Learned
- Accessing array elements with `[index]`
- `.map()` for transformation
- `.filter()` for selection
- `.find()` for first matching item
- `.some()` / `.every()` for boolean checks
- `.push()` / `.pop()` for adding/removing items

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Typos in variable names → `ReferenceError`
- Tried `cd` into a file instead of a folder → `not a directory`
- Forgot closing `]` in an array → syntax error

### 💡 Notes
- `.every()` returns a boolean, not matching items
- `.map()` always returns a new array, doesn’t change the original

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Structured file with clear headings for each method
- Used labeled `console.log()` outputs for clarity

---

## Day 6 – Functions Return
**Focus:** Converting values & reusing functions

### ✅ What I Learned
- Returning calculated results
- Converting kg to lbs and vice versa

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Forgot to `return` → function output was `undefined`

### 💡 Notes
- Always check that your function returns a value if needed

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Wrote clear, descriptive function names

---

## Day 5 – Functions Basics
**Focus:** Creating and calling functions

### ✅ What I Learned
- Defining functions with parameters
- Returning values

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Added extra comma in parameters → syntax error

### 💡 Notes
- Functions can return results to be stored in variables

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Created multiple small, reusable functions

---

## Day 4 – Conditionals
**Focus:** Making decisions with if/else

### ✅ What I Learned
- `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- Nesting conditions
- Combining logical operators inside conditions

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Missing curly braces caused unexpected results

### 💡 Notes
- Indent nested conditions for clarity

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Created decision-making code for score comparisons

---

## Day 3 – Loops
**Focus:** Looping through tasks

### ✅ What I Learned
- `for` loops (start; condition; update)
- Iterating over arrays

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Forgot to update loop variable → infinite loop

### 💡 Notes
- Always ensure loop variable changes or you’ll loop forever

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Broke loop logic into small, testable chunks

---

## Day 2 – Expressions & Operators
**Focus:** Basic math & logic in JS

### ✅ What I Learned
- Arithmetic operators (`+ - * /`)
- Comparison operators (`> >= ===`)
- Logical operators (`&& ||`)

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Mixed up `>=` with `=>` (arrow function syntax)

### 💡 Notes
- Parentheses help control order in calculations

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Applied operators to simple challenges like pass/fail checks

---

## Day 1 – Variables & Data Types
**Focus:** Declaring and using variables

### ✅ What I Learned
- Using `let` to declare variables
- Concatenating strings with `+`
- Storing and updating values

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Used `"name"` instead of variable name → printed literal "name"

### 💡 Notes
- Variables store values; when combining text and variables, don’t put quotes around variable name

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Practiced simple outputs with `console.log()`

---

## Day 0 – Setup & Intro
**Focus:** Setting up repo and environment for 100 Days of Code

### ✅ What I Learned
- Creating a GitHub repo and linking it to VS Code
- Using `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` in terminal
- Creating files in VS Code and terminal (`touch filename.js`)
- Running JS files with `node filename.js`

### 🐛 Errors I Hit
- Terminal couldn't find the file → ran `node` from wrong folder
- Needed to `pwd` to confirm current location

### 💡 Notes
- Always confirm file location with `ls` and `pwd` before running
- Keep folder/file names consistent (no typos)

### 🎯 What I Did Well
- Organized folder structure for daily files
- Successfully pushed first commit to GitHub
